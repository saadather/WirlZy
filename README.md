# WirlZy

Technology
----------

* UI is developed using Angular JS:
  [https://angularjs.org](https://angularjs.org)
  [https://github.com/johnpapa/angularjs-styleguide](https://github.com/johnpapa/angularjs-styleguide)
* UI is composed of a core module and service modules for different functional groups
* Modules are developed using directives, here is a good read on the topic:
  http://briantford.com/blog/angular-bower
* The backend of the application are written in ExpressJS (RESTful), the ui services call the REST APIs
* Styling the application is done using SASS:
  http://sass-lang.com/
* Styling is based on Bootstrap CSS, a Bootstrap CSS is used for the portal:
  [http://getbootstrap.com/](http://getbootstrap.com/) & [https://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/](https://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/)
* Localization is done using angular translation
* Unit testing is written using Mocha with Karma
* End to end testing is based on the JS Selenium framework: Protractor
* Build process is built and run with Grunt.js


## Project Setup
* Install Git, SASS, NodeJS
* Install Yeoman, Grunt-Cli and Bower using the command
```
npm install -g yo grunt-cli bower
```

Contribute
----------

We use pull requests, and consequentially the forking model.  To make a contribution, you will need to fork this repository, make some changes, and then create a pull request with your changes.

1. From this web page, click **Fork** at the upper-right hand corner of the page
2. Select your username (e.g. @saadather)
3. After your new fork is created, you'll want to pull the fork to your local environment, and add the upstream and jenkins remotes:
 - `git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/WirlZy.git`
 - `git remote add upstream https://github.com/saadather/WirlZy.git`

When you're making changes to your fork, you'll push to your fork with `git push origin master`, and your pull request will get automatically updated with the latest pushes you've made.

When your pull request gets approved by someone, this means you're able to push to jenkins with `git push jenkins master`. Clicking the "Merge" button will not merge into master since we used gated builds. This means that Jenkins is the only one who is capable of pushing to master to ensure our repository stays clean.

To summarize, this is the process:

1. You fork the WirlZy repository
2. You make changes on your fork
3. You commit and push your changes to your fork (`git add`, `git commit`)
4. You create a pull request
5. Someone reviews your code and gives you feedback
6. Eventually, your code will get approved
7. You pull the latest changes (`git pull upstream master`)
8. Your code gets merged

Keeping your fork up-to-date
----------------------------

When contributing, it's important to keep your fork up-to-date with the master. You can do so by running the following command: `git pull upstream master`
